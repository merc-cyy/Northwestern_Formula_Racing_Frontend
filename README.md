# Northwestern Formula Racing Organization

## Data Acquisition Interface Team

### Background
Every year, Northwestern University has a Formula Organization that makes an actual **Formula One** car from scratch and races the car at an annual collegiate race.

I aggregated data coming from the **80** sensors on the car and visualized it for the engineering teams and later on for final competitions.

This repository contains:
- The frontend UI layer of our visualization tool. Since the frontend is required to do a lot of calculations and graphing of data, I preferred Python over JavaScript for this project.
